# meanCrud

This is a incomplete Project. I'll update it once I'm done in front end

But the backend is okay

If you clone it.

Ignore the angularApp folder.

1. Clone or download the project
2. Open terminal and Run "sudo service mongod start" to start the mongoDB server
3. After that run "mongo"
4. After runnning the mongoDB, go to local directories of folder cd meanCrud
5. There you can run the application by running this command to terminal "node/nodemon index.js"
6. It should return message to console like "Port is connected to: 3001" and "Connected to MongoDB!"
7. There you can now try the application by opening the Insomia or Postman to test the Post, Put, Get, Delete Function
8. localhost:3001

-Thank you
